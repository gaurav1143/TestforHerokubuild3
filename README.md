# Welcome to ASP.NET 5 on Heroku

This project deploys a sample ASP.NET 5 web application to Heroku using the latest ASP.NET Core Buildpack. Specifically, it will take a very generic ASP.NET web application, created in Visual Studio, and deploy it to Heroku using the ASP.NET Core Framework's buildpack.

## This application consists of:

*   Heroku Buildpack running the ASP.NET Core latest release
*   [Gulp](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518007) and [Bower](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518004) for managing client-side libraries
*   Theming using [Bootstrap](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398939)

## What is .NET Core? 
A re-imagined version of .NET that is suitable to be deployed alongside web apps and places a strong focus on a new set of assemblies and APIs based on the PCL 2.0 profile. This is a full open source project, with Microsoft taking contributions and developing in the open. This is owned and supported by Microsoft.

## How is this different from Mono? 
The version published under Mono is a snapshot of the .NET Framework source code. While Microsoft is publishing the source code, they are not actively developing Mono, nor are they taking patches. This is not supported by Microsoft. To read more about the differences, check out http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/dotnet-integration/
